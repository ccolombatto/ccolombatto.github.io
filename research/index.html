                    One of the most striking things that we can perceive is the direct gaze of another person — as when we are sitting (err..used to sit, pre-covid?) in a restaurant and suddenly notice that someone across the room is staring right at us (yikes!).
                    It has long been thought that we are so attentive to others’ eyes because they are so visually salient. But another possibility is that the eyes draw our attention because they are, as the saying goes, ‘a window to the soul’: they signal the direction of others’ attention and intentions. In this way, eye contact might be better characterized as but one instance of a more general phenomenon of mind contact.
                    We have explored this possibility using two complementary approaches: click below to learn more!

                <p>In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the effects of eye gaze vanish in the presence of stimuli that do not actually signify any underlying pattern of intention and attention, even if they clearly look like eyes.
                This occurs, for example, in a phenomenon we called <i>gaze deflection</i>: you are surreptitiously looking at someone, and then when they catch you staring at them, you immediately turn away (oops!).  We found that gazes
                are markedly less effective at orienting an observer's attention when they are seen as 'deflected' in this way, suggesting that our visual system is well-tuned to extract the 'mind behind the eyes'.

                <p>In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the effects of direct gaze arise even without eyes, as long as an agent's directed attention is conveyed by other means.
                For example, we have recently shown that the ‘stare-in-the-crowd’ effect, wherein faces are detected more readily when they look directly toward you, also arises with simple geometric shapes when they are seen as directed at the observer.</p>
